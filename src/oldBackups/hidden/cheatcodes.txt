So you want to run the RC Car?

Make sure both batteries have enough power to run.

//On your linux enviroment: RUN the follow to connect to the raspberry pi on the RC car
    ssh ubuntu@10.108.95.102
    username: ubuntu
    password: ubuntu

----------------------------------------|
//RUN THIS ON BOTH your enviroment and the raspberry pi                                        
//Go to the ROS workspace               |
    cd ~/catkin_ws/                     |
                                        |
//prepare the enviroment                |
    source devel/setup.bash             |
                                        |
----------------------------------------|

//now here you will need to know the IP address of 
    ifconfig

//on both the raspberry pi and our linux enviromrnt 
    cd ~/catkin_ws/ 
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=://http:10.108.95.102:11311

//RUN THIS ON ONLY raspberry pi
    export ROS_IP=10.108.95.102
    export ROS_HOSTNAME=10.108.95.102

//RUN THIS ON ONLY your linux enviroment
    export ROS_IP=[YOUR IP]
    export ROS_HOSTNAME=[YOUR IP]

// THE IP and the HOSTNAME should match the one of unique to that machine
// TO check run....
    env |grep ROS

-------------

// on the PI
    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    roslaunch simp_motor web.launch

-----------

//on your laptop you will need two terminals 
// on one of the terminals 
    roscore
//on the other terminal
    rosrun joy joy_node

//Note if the car doesn't move open another terminal anywhere and run...
    cd catkin_ws
    source devel/setup.bash
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=://http:10.108.95.102:1131
    export ROS_IP=[IP OF DEVICE YOUR CHECKING FROM]
    export ROS_HOSTNAME=[IP OF DEVICE YOUR CHECKING FROM]
    rostopic echo /joy
//If you do not see any joy stick messages your device cannot read them or does not have permission
//ONCE THIS IS FIX THE CAR WILL RUN
//THIS IS MY HINT GOOD LUCK!! 
//SEND ME A MESSAGE ONCE YOU GET HERE! =)
